# LISFLOODMATLAB
MATLAB (and some R) scripts for pre- and post-processing LISFLOOD-FP inputs and outputs.

The following files are from https://source.ggy.bris.ac.uk/wiki/LISFLOOD-FP_and_MATLAB:
ascii_reader.m
ascii_write.m
lisflood_flow_plotter.m
prm_writer.m
profileread.m
stage_read.m

There are a couple Python scripts for producing input files; contact me for info.
